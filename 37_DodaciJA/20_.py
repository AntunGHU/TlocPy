# Python Web Development Tutorials
# Python is a beautiful language. It’s easy to learn and fun, and its syntax (the rules) is clear and concise. Python is a popular choice # for beginners, yet still powerful enough to back some of the world’s most popular products and applications from companies like NASA, # Google, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft, Industrial Light & Magic among others.
#
# One area where Python shines is web development. Python offers many frameworks from which to choose from including bottle.py, Flask, # CherryPy, Pyramid, Django and web2py. These frameworks have been used to power some of the world’s most popular sites such as Spotify, # Mozilla, Reddit, the Washington Post and Yelp. The tutorials and articles in this section cover techniques used in the development of # Python Web applications and focus on how to program real-world solutions to problems that ordinary people actually want to solve.
#
# What you will learn from this section
# Testing, mocking and Test Driven Development
# Integrating back-end code with front-end libraries and frameworks
# How to deploy your Python Web Application
# Containerizing web applications
# Designing and interacting with APIs
# Social Authentication
# Improving your application’s performance through caching
# Free Bonus: Click here to get access to a free Django Learning Resources Guide (PDF) that shows you tips and tricks as well as common # pitfalls to avoid when building Python + Django web applications.
#
# Free Bonus: Click here to get access to a free Flask + Python video tutorial that shows you how to build Flask web app, step-by-step.
