#! Question 1
# for loops are used to loop over:
# loopy objects
# numbers
# iterable objects
# lines of code
#? Correct Answer
# iterable objects
# 
#! Question 2
# What is the tradeoff when using while loops for looping?
# while  loops are more flexible since you explicitly set the start and end conditions, but they require # more setup than for  loops.
# while  loops are faster than for  loops but require more setup.
# while  loops can loop infinitely and give you more control, but they cannot be used to iterate over # iterable objects.
#? Correct Answer
# while  loops are more flexible since you explicitly set the start and end conditions, but they require # more setup than for  loops.
# 
#! Question 3
# What does the break  keyword do?
# Exits the loop at the beginning of the next iteration.
# Breaks your code.
# Exits the loop at the end of this iteration.
# Exits the loop immediately.
#? Correct Answer
# Exits the loop immediately.
