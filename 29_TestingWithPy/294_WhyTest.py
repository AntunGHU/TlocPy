# Why test?
# _____Reduce bugs in existing code
# _____Ensure bugs that are fixed stay fixed
# _____Ensure new features don't break old
# _____Ensure that cleaning up code doesn't introduce new bugs
# _____Makes dev more fun! (ali i mnogo sporijim!)

# Test driven development
# _____Dev pocinje s testovima
# _____Kad su testovi napisani pisemo kod koji ce proci test
# _____Ako code prodje testove, feature se smatra zavrsenim
# _____Filozofija ili religija sa pristasama ili protivnicima!!!

# Red, Green, Refactor
# 1) Red_Write test that fails
# 2) Green_write min ammount of code to pass test
# 3) Refactor_Clean up code while ensuring that tests still pass

# Why test?
# ? Reduce bugs in existing code
# ? Ensure bugs that are fixed stay fixed
# ? Ensure that new features don't break old ones
# ? Ensure that cleaning up code doesn't introduce new bugs
# ? Makes development more fun!
# Test Driven Development
# ? Development begins by writing tests
# ? Once tests are written, write code to make tests pass
# ? Once tests pass, a feature is considered complete
# Red, Green, Refactor
# ? Red - Write a test that fails
# ? Green - Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass
# ? Refactor - Clean up the code, while ensuring that tests still pass
